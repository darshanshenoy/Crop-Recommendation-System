# Crop-Recommendation-System
Predicts best suited crop based on weather and soil parameters.


This repository consists of a PDF file named "Crop Recommendation System Report". It is a detailed report of the project. 

The repository also contains 4 python files-

1. Data mining- This file contains plots which can be used to understand the dataset well.
2. Outlier Management- Here I have removed outliers from the dataset using IQR method.
3. Algorithm Comparision- In this file, I have compared all the possible classification algorithms based on their accuracies.
4. Algorithm Implementation- I have implemented Random Forest algorithm as it gives the highest accuracy of 99.01%
